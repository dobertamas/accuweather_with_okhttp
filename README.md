Simple practice app to learn Android technologies, based on ideas from TreeHouse courses; namely:
having multiple activities;
passing data using Intent and Parcelable interface;
using external library com.squareup.okhttp3 to perform HTTP GET from Accuweather in the background;
adding permissions to the Manifest file;
parsing JSON response into JSONObject and getting JSONArray from JSONObject;
building data model to receive incoming data into objects.

Regarding layout:
adding a Button and customizing it;
using android.support.v7.widget.RecyclerView;
adding TextView and ImageView;
injecting them using 3rd party library com.jakewharton:butterknife.

Also creating an Adapter, extending RecyclerView.Adapter
and displaying some list items with a static image.
